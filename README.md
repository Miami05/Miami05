## 🎯 About Me

Software engineer specializing in **AI systems**, **high-performance backends**, and **scalable infrastructure**. I combine low-level systems optimization (C/C++) with modern AI architectures (LLMs, RAG) to build production-grade intelligent solutions.
Currently advancing through **42 Wolfsburg** (systems programming bootcamp) and **MasterSchool AI Engineering** program. Transitioning from traditional software engineering to AI-focused roles while maintaining deep systems fundamentals.

## 🚀 Currently Building

- **Travel Optimization System** ✈️: Multi-country routing with AI + Neo4j (in development)  
- **Code Intelligence Platform** 💻: GitHub repo analyzer with semantic search + interactive knowledge graphs (MVP)
- **Simplified Knowledge Graph** 📊: Interactive visualization of code dependencies and function relationships (MVP)


## 🏆 What I Build

I engineer **production-grade AI systems and high-performance backend solutions** that solve real-world problems. My work spans:

- **🤖 AI/ML Systems**: LLM integration, RAG pipelines, prompt optimization, deploying intelligent systems at scale
- **⚙️ Systems Engineering**: C/C++ performance optimization, Unix/Linux fundamentals, memory management
- **🚀 Full-Stack Development**: Python/FastAPI backends, scalable databases (PostgreSQL, Neo4j), RESTful APIs

Currently: **42 Wolfsburg** (Software Engineering bootcamp) + **MasterSchool AI Engineering**
